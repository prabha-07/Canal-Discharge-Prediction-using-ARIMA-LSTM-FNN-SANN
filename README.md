# Canal-Discharge-Prediction-using-ARIMA-LSTM-FNN-SANN

## ABSTRACT
To protect waterbodies, constant monitoring is required.  In that respect, as the first step of monitoring, we are going to predict the discharge values of a lake channel using Machine Learning algorithms.  Here in our project, we have taken Thevara Perandoor Canal, present in Kerala.  Then we are going to predict the future discharge of this canal basin for about 15 years, with the help of Machine Learning tool.  As we are using 4 different machine learning models, we are also going to compare these four models and determine the best suited model which can better predict the discharge at sub-basin of this canal.  The main input data for the prediction is the 64-year rainfall precipitation values for the district in which the canal is present.  In future, we can compare the predicted values with the actual values to indirectly determine any causes happened to the waterbody and hence ensure its effective functioning.  Therefore, the objective is to predict the future discharge values of the canal and also to find the best suited machine learning model that can be used to predict the discharge values for this canal basins, hence we can use the same model to predict for other canal discharge prediction having similar rainfall pattern as of this undertaken canal.
